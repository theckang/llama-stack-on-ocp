We did this by initializing an agent with access to two MCP servers that were registered to our Llama Stack server, then invoked the agent on our specified set of queries. We showed that we can do this with more directed Prompt Chaining or with the more open ended ReAct pattern. Please check out our next notebooks, [Agents, MCP and RAG](Level6_agents_MCP_and_RAG.ipynb) for more examples of extending your agents capabilities with Llama Stack."
